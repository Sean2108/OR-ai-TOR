# OR-ai-TOR

# Inspiration
Each and everyone of us has struggled with some fear in our life that held us back from achieving our potential. From students to even great artists alike, most of us have quietly suffered from the fear of the audience, or the fear of public speech. But today, success in life is dependent not only on one's skills but also on the confidence and charm one holds. So our team decided that we wanted to do something about it.

OR{ai}TOR helps you become an even better orator with practice runs, evaluations based on some of the best speakers in the world and keeping track of your personal improvement and growth style. Our app can also be aimed at foreign nationals/elderly who want to practice/learn to speak in English but are often deterred to do so because of embarrassment. Thus, the long term purpose of the app is two-fold: empowering minorities by giving them a tool to express themselves and helping people enhance their professional speech.

# What it does
OR{ai}TOR runs on an artificial intelligence model that is trained on data sets to recognize higher quality of speech from some of the most influential speakers of the world like Obama. The model learns from these speeches and compares parameters like pitch variation, intonation (deviations in loudness) & voice modulation, overall speech rhythm and tonality. It also reports the excessive use of filler words and provides a relative result to the user accordingly. The user can record themselves speaking out loud and let the agent analyze their performance. The user can be assured of being in the hands of the best mentors!

# How we built it
React-native for frontend app development (iOS, Android) Keras API for AI to create our deep learning model libROSA for music and audio analysis and calculating quality of voice parameters & voice spectrograms Audioset & other online open source .wav speech datasets to train the model Python as our base language for to design the software
